## Repo Structure

- The README contains your assignments
- The `assignments` folder is where you will put your work when you
  submit a pull request to me. This is also where I will post
  solutions after the classwork/homework should have already been
  done.

## Assignments

Each assignment has the following format:

Date given: description. Due date. Assignment name.

The due date means before class on that date. So if a homework is due
on 7/17, then it is due before 10:00 AM on 7/17.

For any assignment where I ask you to solve a problem, please post
your solution in your github using the path
`cs/week#/day#/assignment-name`, where the week and day correspond to
the *due date* of the assignment. For example, assignment 3 would be
placed in `cs/week2/day1/hash-implementations`. 

### What if the problem is too hard?

If you are not able to solve the problem at home then post up a
text file containing the following:

- a description of the approach(s) you thought of
- a description of where you got stuck on these approaches. For
  example:
    - Was there a flaw in the approach you found and you had to think
      of a new one? What was the flaw? How did you try to get around
      it?
    - Were you just unable to implement the approach? Which part(s)
      were you unable to implement, and why?
- whatever part of a program you wrote if you wrote one
